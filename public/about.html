<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Main Information</h2>
<p>Hello! I am Qewzdl.</p>
<p>I am a person who has been passionate about creativity and programming since childhood. My goal is to create something groundbreaking that can change the world, and I am ready to work tirelessly to achieve it. I draw at a professional level, make music, and code, and I enjoy finding ways to combine these fields in my projects.</p>
<p>I’m an introvert, and communicating with people isn’t easy for me, but I feel comfortable with those I’m close to. My strength lies in my ability to focus on my ideas and bring them to life. I enjoy developing complex projects, whether they’re games, websites, or something entirely new that doesn’t yet exist in the world.</p>
<p>For me, it’s important not just to follow the standards but to create something unique. I’m always looking for original ideas and unconventional solutions. My life is a blend of art and technology, and I strive to create by drawing inspiration from both.</p>
